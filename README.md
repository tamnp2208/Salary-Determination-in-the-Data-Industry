# Salary Determination in the Data Industry

Welcome to the Salary Determination in the Data Industry project! This project aimed to provide valuable insights into the factors that 
influence data analyst salaries and shed light on the dynamics of the job market in this field. My goal was to identify the key job 
characteristics that are most strongly associated with salary estimates for data related jobs. Furthermore, I determined whether 
there are any significant differences in the relationship between company type and salary. Lastly, I used linear regression to predict 
salaries based on the presence of certain skills. This project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex real-world problems using statistical techniques. 
I am proud to share my findings and insights with the community, and I hope that my work contributes to the advancement of analytics and 
the understanding of salary of data-related job in the US.
